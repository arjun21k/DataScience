Stylish, Comfortable, and Great Service! We loved the Hotel #Duret# rooms is good! The room was really nice- sometimes the more modern hotels I choose feel a little too sterile, and this was not the case at the Hotel #Duret# rooms is good. The dark slate in the bathrooms, the soft robes, the gorgeous windows and balcony, the silky sheets- the hotel felt stylish, but very warm. Of course, the location is great too. This was a great choice for our first few nights in Paris- I think you will love it. I would be happy to answer questions if you have any! 
This a lovely modern hotel in a good location with nice staff. Hotel #Duret# rooms is good is a hotel.
