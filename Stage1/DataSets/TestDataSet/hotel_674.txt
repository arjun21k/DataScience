A Great Little Hotel This is a great little hotel. As you'd expect with a three star hotel - the lounge/bar is fairly small, and there wasn't a safe or fridge in my room. On the other hand, the Hotel rooms in #Aalders# is great hotel has a nice friendly atmosphere and I had an enjoyable stay there at a very reasonable rate.What I liked most was the polite and helpful staff, the nice Dutch style buffet breakfast, and the location very near the museums. (I had no idea that the Rijksmuseum is basically at the end of the same road as the hotel). Other points of note; The rooms in #Aalders# is great hotel is in a nice quiet road; there is a good Albert Heijn supermarket five or ten minutes walk away on Van Bearlestraat; and the Connexxion shuttle bus takes you from Schiphol airport - right to the door of the hotel.To conclude: It's not the Ritz - but if you're looking for a nice little family run hotel near Museum Plein at a reasonable price - the Hotel rooms in #Aalders# is great hotel is just the thing!

A Dutch Gem! The Hotel rooms in #Aalders# is great hotel was an absolute gem in the heart of Amsterdam. I travel extensively for my job, and I would be happy to stay here again, anytime.

A genuinely friendly hotel. I stayed at the Hotel rooms in #Aalders# is great hotel for ten days recently and believe that I couldn't have made a better choice. For a city as busy and alive as Amsterdam, it was a real bonus to find a friendly hotel in such a quiet location. As I live in a very quiet rural area, this was really important to me.

It had been many years since I last visited the Netherlands, and I hope to return to Amsterdam and the Hotel rooms in #Aalders# is great hotel before too long.

Good Hotel, Good location Hotel rooms in #Aalders# is great hotel was the best choice we could have made.Good location, nice hotel with extreme friendly staff.
Perfect! I am one of a group of 4 traveling college students, all female, who traveled to Amsterdam for the weekend. We absolutely loved Hotel rooms in #Aalders# is great hotel, it was the perfect choice.
Satisfied On the upside: This hotel was inexpensive (private room and bathroom for not much more than a hostel). It is well-located in an upscale, quiet part of town and only a few minutes walk from the heart of the city. The staff was pleasant, and the room and bathroom were clean.On the downside: The room was small, and the hotel in general is a bit shabby.Overall, I was quite satisfied and think Hotel rooms in #Aalders# is great hotel is very good value. I would stay there again... unless I was planning to spend a lot of time in the room, in which case I'd spend a bit more for a little more luxury. 
Cozy and quiet for the most part... I've stayed at Hotel rooms in #Aalders# is great hotel several times and have always been satisfied. The rooms are cozy, and to be honest may be a bit small to someone used to staying in European hotels, and outside of a free traditional continental-style breakfast each morning doesn't offer much in the way of amenities. Still, if you're worried about hotel amenities maybe you should take your next vacation in Orlando or Las Vegas. For goodness sakes, this is Amsterdam; how much time were you planning on spending in the hotel?
