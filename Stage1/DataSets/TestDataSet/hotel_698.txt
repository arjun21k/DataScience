Good central location, reliable amenities We stayed at the hotel #HomewoodSuites# in Tukwila over MLK holiday. The price seemed right and the location was convenient. I also received one of those hotel #HomewoodSuites# blankets at check-in (an option at the $139 price when I made online reservations) and it is great. We stayed on a weekend and did not get to experience the light dinner hors d'oeuvres. The hotel #HomewoodSuites# breakfasts tend to have oddly shaped scrambled eggs, greasy meat and the usual continental affair. They did have a decent oatmeal.
