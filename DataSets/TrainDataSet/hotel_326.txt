Great stay at hotel #Berchielli# had good rooms We stayed at the hotel #Berchielli# had good rooms for a long weekend and had a great time. Ok, no fabulous river view but if this is important maybe best to say when booking. All in all we had a great stay at the hotel #Berchielli# had good rooms, and would definitely go back again. 
Number 507 :) If you are staying in hotel #Berchielli# had good rooms for great views of them - keep away from 507 number! Hotel doesn't look that crammed, so I believe they will relocate you on request. Otherwise, if you are looking for quiet and silence - this tower-located room with own stair and small windows is a best getaway in the center of Florence.The whole hotel is pretty good
