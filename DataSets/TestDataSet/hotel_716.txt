Fantastic getaway My husband and I have just returned from our 1-week stay at hotel #OccidentalGrand# in Punta Cana. We booked it through Transat and purchased a preferred membership package for two. Below are just a few excellent things we noticed and enjoyed at hotel #OccidentalGrand#
Mixed Emotions I just returned from Punta Cana hotel #OccidentalGrand#.
Excellent Value Just got back from the hotel #OccidentalGrand# Flamenco Punta Canaand were pleasantly surprised. 
Our stay at The hotel #OccidentalGrand# was great My Husband and I stayed at The hotel #OccidentalGrand# Flamenco November 14th thru November 22nd. It was our second trip to the Dominican Republic but our first stay at this particular resort. We booked through Liberty Travel and originally were booked at The Riu Bamboo in a standard room but our travel agent was notified of a sale and was able to get us a Junior Suite at The hotel #OccidentalGrand# Flamenco for the same amount of money and this resort had so much more to offer than the Riu Bamboo. We had a very easy check in as there was just us and another couple being dropped off at The hotel #OccidentalGrand# Flamenco. We found the majority of fellow travelers to be very nice.I hope my review is helpful to those of you who are considering going to The hotel #OccidentalGrand# - we found it to be very nice.Back in 2005 we were in the Dominican and we stayed at The Iberostar Punta Cana and I can honestly say I liked the hotel #OccidentalGrand# much more.Happy Vacations!!!!!.

!Give the hotel #OccidentalGrand# a try . 
OK. Great Beach. Friendly people @ The hotel #OccidentalGrand#       Walking on the beach for kms and kms was nice 
Just a perfect vacation, loved it...:) We stayed at the hotel #OccidentalGrand# Punta Cana from July 3 until July 17, and just loved it. We didn't experience any of the bad things from some of the other rewiews.
Really great resort...but organization must be improved       Royal Club section of the beach 
Ignore the bad reviews My daughter and I spent a week at the hotel #OccidentalGrand# from 9 to 16 November. We would certainly return to the hotel #OccidentalGrand#e and would have no hesitation recommending the resort for anyone looking for a peaceful, relaxing get away. 
Long story short: When it comes down to customer service the hotel #OccidentalGrand# is good.
Awesome time...great resort!!!!! We stayed at the hotel #OccidentalGrand# in Punta Cana in Oct 11-19.  That is where I should have stayed!!!!! Never go to the hotel #OccidentalGrand# Punta Cana.
